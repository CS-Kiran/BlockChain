# Blockchain Learning with Python 🧠💻

Welcome to my **Blockchain Learning Repository**! 🚀 This repository is a collection of Python scripts and projects I am working on as I learn the fundamentals of blockchain technology.

## 🌟 Goals of This Repository
1. **Learn Blockchain Basics:** Understand key concepts like blocks, chains, hashing, and consensus mechanisms.
2. **Build Blockchain Projects:** Create simple implementations of blockchain systems using Python.
3. **Document the Journey:** Record my learning progress with clear, well-documented code and notes.

🛠 Technologies Used
--------------------

*   **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
    
*   **Libraries:**
    
    *   hashlib: For cryptographic hash functions.
        
    *   time: For adding timestamps.
        
    *   Any others as needed for advanced features.
        

🚧 Current Progress
-------------------

*   ✅ Built a basic blockchain implementation.
    
*   ✅ Explored SHA-256 hashing and its importance in blockchain.
    
*   🚧 Next Steps: Implement Proof of Work and a simple peer-to-peer network.
    

📖 Topics I'm Learning
----------------------

1.  **Hashing**: Understanding cryptographic hash functions like SHA-256.
    
2.  **Blocks and Chains**: Creating blocks and linking them into a chain.
    
3.  **Consensus Mechanisms**: Exploring proof-of-work (PoW) and other consensus models.
    
4.  **Smart Contracts**: Writing simple smart contracts (future goal).
    
5.  **Decentralization**: Experimenting with peer-to-peer networks.
